# RAMP IoT LD Platform
The RAMP IoT LD (Linked Data) Platform utilizes a FIWARE installation, designed to be implemented on factory premises and integrated with the RAMP marketplace. It compatible with the [NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.07.01_60/gs_cim009v010701p.pdf) (Next Generation Service Interfaces) specifications. This platform setup serves as a template, equipped with minimal configurations to facilitate a smooth startup. Utilizing [FIWARE generic enablers](https://github.com/FIWARE/catalogue), the RAMP IoT platform is established. 

## Architecture 
The main components of the RAMP IoT LD platform are:
1. [Orion-LD](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD) as Context Broker.
2. [Mintaka](https://github.com/FIWARE/mintaka) as NGSI-LD temporal retrieval API.
3. [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as single sign-on with identity and access management.
4. [Kong](https://github.com/FIWARE/kong-plugins-fiware) as PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) proxy for Orion-LD and Mintaka.
5. [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) to store all entities received by Orion-LD.
6. [Quantumleap](https://github.com/orchestracities/ngsi-timeseries-api) and [CrateDB](https://cratedb.com) for compatibility with older RAMP-IoT installation. Do not use for new installations.

The user can use a number of already developed [IoT Agents and Generic Enablers](https://github.com/FIWARE/catalogue#interface-with-iot-robots-and-third-party-systems) developed by FIWARE to provide data to the RAMP-IoT-LD platform.

# Demo
For demonstration prepusus a demo application has been implemented. See **[Demo.md](demo/Demo.md)**

## Prerequisite
RAMP IoT LD platform runs in Docker containers and hence Docker and Docker-Compose are required. Machine where IoT platform can be either virtual machine or real computer, but it needs to have sufficient resources. Environment requires these _minimum_ resources:
- 5GB RAM (Hard minum limit, more is better)
- 50GB Disk space (more as needed for the data that is being stored)
- 4 CPU's (less can work but results in performance loss)

Disk space for database
- 43Mb for a 70,000 rows (each different measurement has a unique row.ie sensor measure 4 variables for each timestamp, 4 rows will be added to the db + addidtional relactioshipes ).
